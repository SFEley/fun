Starting Out
============
So my goals are:

1. Write a simple Tumblr-like aggregatorish... _thing_... that I can use to collect any Twitter tweets, LiveJournal posts, email messages, or whatever else I do that might be clever and which I might want to refer to later (or have others refer to -- wouldn't that be swell.)
2. Have a practical MongoDB project in such a state that it's worth showing when I present at the Atlanta Ruby Users Group meeting on October 7.
3. Document real behavior-driven development (BDD) using Cucumber and RSpec in a real context.

First steps. I just created the Rails project and added my favorite toys:

    rails fun
    cd fun
    script/generate rspec
    script/generate cucumber
    haml --rails .
    git add . && git commit -am "Start from scratch"
    
Because there is no interface yet to make posts in, I'm saving this in a text file under **fun/doc/diary** with a timestamp as the filename -- it'll become a fixture record.  Next up is the first Cucumber story.
